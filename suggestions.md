* Maybe add some pictures inside the diary. Add the reading lists of each grade in the diary. Keep the BFF page at the back for BFF's to sign. Add a folder at the back, big enough to put papers in.
* make the graphics cooler make the diary bigger and in hard cover add some "how to make.." add some pictures  Make the BFF page better add a folder at the end of the diary so you could put more papers in add a chocolate bar to every diary
* Change the colors please.
* Maybe attach the soft plastic cover to the actual 'front paper cover' because its a bit annoying that they're separate :)

* I like front cover without pictures.
* The triangle plastic pocket to put papers in broke really easily and I couldn't use it for most of the semesters although I put many small pieces of papers in my diary. 
* Something about the Student Council
* I think as far as increasing the space to write homework it should be two or three pages per day.
* Try and make the front cover more appealing, i think you should probrably put a map of the school for the new children as i found it difficult navigating
* how about no diary yaaaaaaaaaaay
* I am PI
* You should add the link to Alekto's soundcoud page http://bit.ly/1gf9L6V
* no diary please 
* The plastic cover always breaks
* I am satisfied by the way the school diary looked for this school year but I would definitely recommend more home-work writing space. I would prefer for the diaries to be slightly bigger but definitely smaller than the rest of our books. We don't want them to be too heavy and a burden for students to carry.   I love the idea of having a map of our school in the diaries, with tips and advice on studying, staying organized, and getting better grades. I often look these tips on the internet just to motivate myself to stay organized and try harder for school. Therefore I think they'd be great.  
* Our panther mascot should be in the diary!
* Stop putting the art work on to the cover pages. Instead put a relaxing picture of nature. Thanks
* Which kind of online-service (for the diary) would you use? Would it be one that is linked to the student email? If so, I would not use it because it's too complicated to access...  Hi Alex, Jakub, Riffi :)
* you should try to make it look more interesting so that its more fun to write homework etc. Just to make it less serious and more fun
* I want pictures on cover of diary choose one concept with it.
* Replace the spine with something less scratchy
* Essentially keep the shape and size of the homework diary now. Just simply add all the extra pages people want. 
* Worst diary I have seen in 6 years
* make it black
* -Add 'to do' checklist to homework section -instead of plastic triangle to hold papers have an envelope type slot to hold ID.  - Orginization/study tips and websites would be very useful - math formulas would also be very useful - emergency numbers e.g ambulance, police already included in first page personal info -remove 'parent/teacher' signature space at end of notes page (useless) -add public holidays -use very last page for something other than friend photos -MARKER: Have page marker which clips onto binder part and possibly doubles as short ruler -> page marker  - Different timetable layout and font (very fussy)
* Hard cover would be very nice, and big enough to put papers in when they are folded in half without them rubbing off at the edge. 
* Worst diary ive ever seen in my life, could you make it any uglier please?
* i do not think we should use moodle
* Please keep them the way it is!
* It would be useful if the diary had a section on the notes page for after school activities and other (out of school) activities. Also a to-do lists section would be useful. If the CAS booklet and the homework diary could be joined, it would save people having two separate booklets that they need to bring to and from school everyday.
* Maybe have a different cooler cover? The one we have now, is ok but it could be a little more playful! :) 
* The diary should be better stuck together because every year the papers fall out!
* larger  
* Make it pink
* i would want the design of the diary to be different with NO arts on it, the art pieces are really pretty but after you look at them all the time they get annoying. So I would recomend you would put photos of Sports or really cool doodles. 
* Please, try not to make it much bigger, because if it will have to many pages, it will be to heavy and no one will want to carry it around. The advantage of it being small is that you can always have it with you.
* I think that the separate notes space should be smaller and we could have some of the days (Thursday and Friday) on the second page so that we have more space for writing homework. 
* A lot of people use their smartphones to note down HW so just like we have the Destiny Quest App it will be cool if we also have a homework diary app. 
* Make the diary more school spirited, like adding panthers. So we know this is our schools 
* Put more interesting art on the covers! :)
* 
* I think rather than a line page for notes the right side of the diay, should be divided into sections like: books to take home, to do's, assessment, extra...etc The entire page lined isn't very helpful, or at least for me
* I think it would look good if there is more art work throughout the diary and not only on the cover page. It would make the diary more appealing and fun to use (the quotes achieved this too). These could also be pictures of school events. 
* Maybe there could be some way to keep track of what page you're on? For instance, currently I fold over the bottom corner of a page whenever a new week begins so I can open the diary directly to the day I'm on. Some planners have small, detachable corners.
* we should add more color
* Maybe a little bit more colour on the front? But not too much. Blue is good. :)
* They should stop putting Art pieces on the cover and use other things instead like the VIS photo we took this year. But one thing I wouldn't recommend at all under any circumstances, is to use a picture clearly showing individuals and students since they might not like the picture of them on there. (embarrassement feelings)
* i want the string that holds the paper inside to be much stronger and not to fall off easily. Also the paper shouldn't be torn off easily.
* - maybe we should add more color and we should make it a little bit more artsy. - and it should have a little doodle section where you cant draw and so on.
* Put more artwork on the front and back covers
* Get rid of the squirly spin thing and make it hard cover.
* No
* Please make it more colorful, and I would like there to be 1 day per page.
* Get pretty coloured patterns instead of paintings and art for this once.
* Maybe a bit more colourful and a bit more of information of events, etc...
* no
* Please Please Please make the diary bigger! An A4 sized homework diary would be extremely useful as it could then be used for multiple things!!!
* The plastic cover is constantly break/ ripping so it should be improved or replaced 
* Change of color, and the front and back page need to look different, they look boring right now. 
* Can you make the front page of the diary have a small (or Multiple) tiny comic strip? You can also put them instead of the quotes.  Thanks!
* Please put in certain school events and public holidays because it can be quite difficult to remember and be certain otherwise.   Could we have our individual timetables on the cover or in the inside sleeve?  Something about the VIS Student Council
* I dont mind how the diary currently looks like but maybe make some changes, like the ideas I ticked in this survey earlier.
