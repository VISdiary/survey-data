I would prefer for the diaries to be slightly bigger but definitely smaller than the rest of our books. We don't want them to be too heavy and a burden for students to carry.   I love the idea of having a map of our school in the diaries, with tips and advice on studying, staying organized, and getting better grades. I often look these tips on the internet just to motivate myself to stay organized and try harder for school.
